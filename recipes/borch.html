                            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                            <li>3 medium beets, peeled and grated</li>
                            <li>1 large onion, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
                            <li>2 celery ribs, trimmed and thinly sliced</li>
                            <li>2 large carrots, peeled and julienned</li>
                            <li>3 cups cabbage, thinly shredded</li>
                            <li>1 large potato, peeled and diced</li>
                            <li>1 can (400g) cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
                            <li>4 cups salt-reduced vegetable stock</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Steps</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. Add the grated beet and cook for 5–7 minutes or until slightly softened, stirring occasionally.</li>
                            <li>Pour in the vegetable stock along with water, peppercorns and bay leaves. Add the diced potato and cook for 10 minutes or until it’s halfway done. Stir in the shredded cabbage and cook for another 5–10 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and celery ribs and cook for 5–7 minutes, until the onion turns golden brown. Add the julienned carrot and sauté for an additional 4–5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Now add the tomato paste and cook it for 2–3 minutes. Transfer the contents of the skillet to the pot. Stir well to combine.</li>
                            <li>Add the cannellini beans to the pot. Simmer until the vegetables are tender and the contents of the pot turn ruby red for another 10–15 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add vinegar, minced garlic, salt, pepper and chopped dill. Simmer for another 2–3 minutes to allow the flavours to meld together.</li>
                            <li>Turn off the heat. Adjust the seasonings if needed.</li>
                            <li>Serve the beet borscht hot, garnished with a dollop of yoghurt and some extra fresh dill.</li>
